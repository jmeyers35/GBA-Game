                    YOU KNOW I HAD TO TO IT DO EM: THE GAME
The situation: You, LUCKY LUCIANO, are looking to go out tonight. However, if you go out in your current state, you won't be taken seriously! You don't have enough clout! Your objective in this game is to collect as many pairs of American flag chubbies, increasing your clout as you go, as possible! There's only one problem: as many times as you've done it to em, you've gained a hater who's looking to sabotage your quest for clout: Yung Cash Register, AKA Lil Broomstick! Avoid Lil Broomstick as long as possible and raise your clout!
